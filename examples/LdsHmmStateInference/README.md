# LDS-HMM Example

This repo requires bootstrapping a python virtual environment. I've found that the following method works well.

## Steps to create environment

1. Ensure you have `uv` installed
2. Change directory to the `LdsHmmStateInference` example
3. Run `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `uv sync --no-build-isolation`
